2025-08-02T03:58:34.975079+00:00 | Slackbot:
2025-08-04T13:46:59.845229+00:00 | Suhaas: Suhaas accepted your invitation to join Slack — take a second to say hello.
2025-08-04T18:08:18.483409+00:00 | Ara: Hey Suhaas, are you perhaps familiar with deepseek?
2025-08-04T18:09:00.858289+00:00 | Ara: It was mentioned today by a connection, and I wanted to ask if it's something sustainable and feasible for us to implement as our language model..
2025-08-04T20:17:33.946299+00:00 | Suhaas: Yes, I am familiar with Deepseek.
Deepseek is a really good model open-source model and comparatively cheaper. It is much better at reasoning tasks. But GPT is more flexible for variable tasks.
Choosing a language model is not a concern. For now, we can pick any good model and then it can be changed.
We need to do perform blind testing to see which works better for our use cases.
2025-08-04T21:33:51.723089+00:00 | Ara: Got it. Ok, we'll discuss when we get to the perform blind testing stage then.
2025-08-04T21:34:11.833179+00:00 | Ara: Thanks Suhaas.
2025-08-05T14:02:56.770759+00:00 | Ara: Hi Suhaas, I hadn't noticed that you weren't included in the team meeting invite!
