2025-08-02T03:58:36.241789+00:00 | Slackbot:
2025-08-04T13:47:02.271119+00:00 | Suhaas: Suhaas joined Slack — take a second to say hello.
2025-08-05T08:26:43.275449+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Hey Suhaas, were you able to go through the datasets and identify what docs we would need currently?
2025-08-05T13:54:03.617319+00:00 | Suhaas: Hey Paridhi, I think I missed it. Has Ara shared the internal files for the dataset?
I was thinking of using some public documentations of a product for the starters.
But if we already have the internal docs, could you please share them?
2025-08-05T15:00:08.647149+00:00 | Suhaas: Do we have an active repository to push the code?
2025-08-05T15:00:33.513279+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: no we haven't set up the github yet
2025-08-05T15:01:12.386439+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: also about the dataset did you go ahead and check the sharepoint folder?
2025-08-05T15:02:36.416529+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Ara had posted dataset which she received from Omnissa company and it's a really good and big dataset which we can try and use
2025-08-05T15:04:02.558369+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Also a headsup we might be presenting our prototype first to Omnissa after we finish it. Hence the dataset would be useful for us to work on it
2025-08-05T15:05:51.880799+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: about the github let me ask Ara and set it up..if she needs a different github profile for the company or does she want us to continue using ours.
2025-08-05T15:06:02.658759+00:00 | Suhaas: Oh I forgot about sharepoint.
I will create a GitHub repo from my Olis account and add you as a contributor.
I will try to get the basic RAG pipeline running.
Do you have any preferences for a vector DB? I have used only Pinecone before
2025-08-05T15:06:28.034089+00:00 | Suhaas: Cool I will go through the Omnissa data
2025-08-05T15:07:18.178349+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: no Pinecone works for me
2025-08-05T15:08:05.713619+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Yes also let me also confirm once with Ara if she wants a seperate secured github profile for the company or not
2025-08-05T15:12:08.183459+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: hey up for a short call?
2025-08-05T15:16:19.646919+00:00 | Suhaas: in 15 mins?
2025-08-05T15:19:02.711669+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: okay
2025-08-05T15:35:08.378699+00:00 | Suhaas: you available now?
2025-08-05T16:41:41.084249+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Hi really sorry, was in a call. I just wanted to talk about the dataset and all. So I was thinking we use few documents first to set up the model and then later we can use other docs as well. And about OpenAI API maybe we don't need for now while build RAG pipeline but later when we use I checked up the pricing of it too so its not much. So like for dataset in that itself there are a lot of company folders and then pdfs, docs in them and if even images. So I was thinking for the small dataset we can use like 4-5 companies and 5-6docs under their folders maybe? What do you think?
2025-08-05T16:42:20.060129+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: The docs include NRFs, NDA, PSA etc. docs
2025-08-06T04:01:37.590289+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Any updates?
2025-08-06T14:12:31.324239+00:00 | Suhaas: Can you share your GitHub username created with Olis account?
2025-08-06T15:24:27.041369+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: I sent you an invite for pinecone
2025-08-06T15:25:12.934029+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Pinecone ka API key I have copied in my VS so let me know when you need cause you can't copy it again
2025-08-06T15:25:51.603079+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Githib pe I need to make account with Olis id..let me so that
2025-08-06T15:31:43.024969+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: ParidhiOlis - github
<mailto:paridhit@olis-ai.com|paridhit@olis-ai.com>
2025-08-06T15:44:22.451219+00:00 | Suhaas: API key share kar do
2025-08-06T17:29:59.902189+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: pcsk_4FP3yb_UhhQVf2MsLM1dgwTnqPtpVNbHgj99vmaZeKX9JUbYV9Ebd5WERWibBbsNjnQCw6
2025-08-07T05:31:40.904159+00:00 | Suhaas: what's the pinecone environment value
2025-08-07T05:38:55.258869+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: When you make a pinecone index, there is pinecone environment details too..that's like where it is hosted. I think its similar to how we create a virtual env on VS but its where the vector db is
2025-08-07T05:39:24.011329+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: I haven't created the index yet
2025-08-07T05:39:43.047259+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: So maybe you can create one and then share the details?
2025-08-07T05:40:44.618369+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: I had just created pinecone pe project but not the index
2025-08-07T07:36:41.528069+00:00 | Suhaas: I can focus on the RAG part.
Meanwhile, if you have time can you check how to build overlays like Grmmarly.
1. How to build overlay?
2. How to read existing conversation or mail thread?
We can discuss it tomorrow.
2025-08-07T07:38:01.444769+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Ohh okay cool will do that
2025-08-07T07:38:38.177259+00:00 | Suhaas: I searched on GPT and it gave me this response:
Might be a starting point
2025-08-07T07:40:35.621039+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Wow okay this is good. I'll also check with Claude as it gives really good and deep insights too and probably would also see docs on Google if I could find
2025-08-07T07:41:49.569719+00:00 | Suhaas: cool thanks
2025-08-07T07:44:02.618659+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: No problem btw how is the RAG part going? I was also recommended by Claude to put a logging system too while building it.
2025-08-07T15:25:25.768659+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: So sorry I left before asking if you have any Qs or discussing about the pipeline or overlay. If you want ask or discuss or anything you can send me here. I am looking into the overlay part as well and that's how I actually came up with the Q of how she wants olis to pop out out of those 3 options
2025-08-08T06:04:53.799809+00:00 | Suhaas: Cool, I have pushed the RAG pipeline to Github. Its running at the moment.
Need to add optimizations.
2025-08-08T06:06:08.435429+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Cool nice I'll pull it up and try on mine as well!
2025-08-08T12:06:00.933239+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Hey Suhaas, I am getting the error of max pods reached for pinecone...:smiling_face_with_tear:
2025-08-12T15:18:41.704909+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Hey suhaas, wanted to check are you still using vllm and llama-cpp-python for the backend of our pipeline? Cause like I forgot to mention on Friday when I tried to run it I had also faced problems with the llm backend..vllm I couldn't use and the other one had some installation problem which I am trying to solve.
2025-08-12T15:19:29.317579+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Tabhi toh I tried with ig free OpenAI api key
2025-08-13T14:09:00.195889+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Hey suhaas, will you be able to join today's meeting

2025-08-13T15:44:38.593169+00:00 | Suhaas: for the llm, initially I used quantized Mistral 7B with llamacpp.
Abhi to I am using gpt using the college lab's account (not on Omnissa docs)
2025-08-13T15:45:48.131689+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Okay cool
2025-08-16T12:53:14.043479+00:00 | Paridhi Talwar: Hi Suhaas, I just wanted to know if there is any update from your side. And also the number that you gave do you have whatsapp with that? Just wanted to know as it'll be easier for us to be in contact with each other

Hi Paridhi,

My apologies for the delayed response. I came down with something unexpectedly yesterday and have been offline.

Thank you for following up and confirming my email address. As I'm still not feeling 100%, would it be possible to reschedule our conversation from tomorrow morning? I want to ensure I'm at my best for our discussion.

I am still very keen to chat. Would sometime tomorrow evening work, or perhaps early next week at your convenience?

Thank you for your understanding.

Best,
Prathamesh
